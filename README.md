### Project Description
A calculator that always gives you the wrong answer on purpose. Or, instead of numbers, it returns random sentences!

### [Hosted Link](https://quirkulator.vercel.app/)

### The Problem (that doesn‚Äôt exist)
Ever been overwhelmed by the burden of accurate math? Have you ever felt weighed down by calculators always giving you the correct answer? Numbers, math, and precision can be so stressful. What if you wanted just a bit of random positivity instead of the cold, hard truth of numbers? Why let calculators monopolize ‚Äúcorrectness‚Äù when they could deliver smiles and wrong answers instead?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Enter the **Quirkulator**! Instead of accurate math, this innovative calculator brings you the results you never needed in the first place. With each ‚Äúcalculation,‚Äù it might give you a hilariously off-the-mark answer or, better yet, a random sentences!!

# Diagrams
![Workflow](https://github.com/alvin-dennis/Useless-Projects/blob/main/assets/workflow.png)
This workflow diagram explains the process behind the quirkulator application. Starting from user input, the process flows through calculation initiation and a loading state, leading to a random response generation step. Based on a random condition, the application either produces an incorrect calculation result or returns a playful compliment. Finally, the output is displayed to the user, completing the humorous interaction.
